A quick implementation of the Conway's Game of life in Go with sdl render
## About
I got fascinated about [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) so I decided to implent a personal version to play around with. I used SDL to render the grid because I wanted to learn more about this library.
